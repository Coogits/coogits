# My Knowledge Website

A structured website documenting mathematical concepts, physics principles, and computer science topics. The content is well-organized with a mindmap structure, internal links, and clear explanations.

## Features

- **Mathematics**: Covers discrete math, algebra, geometry, and calculus.
- **Physics**: Includes classical mechanics, thermodynamics, and relativity.
- **Computer Science**: Documents programming concepts, hardware, and software.
- **HTML-Based**: The site is fully converted to HTML from Markdown using a custom Python script.
- **Internal Linking**: The site uses HTML-based internal links, originally derived from Obsidian-style Wikilinks during the conversion process.
- **Formula Reference**: Dedicated section for quick access to mathematical formulas.

## Usage

This repository serves as the source for my website. The content is stored in HTML format, generated from Markdown via a Python script. Simply browse the files or deploy them to a static site host to explore the content.

## Future Improvements

- Enhanced styling and layouts.
- More interactive features for mathematical visualization.
- Expanded content coverage.
- Possible release of the Markdown-to-HTML conversion software for public use.
